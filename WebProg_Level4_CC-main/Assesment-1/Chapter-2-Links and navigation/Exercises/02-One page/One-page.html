                    My daughter introduced me to Ranboo and she is constantly introducing me to amazing things so I watched it . :) It does start of a little bit slow . Episode 1 is more lighthearted and odd. Episode 2 starts to follow darker themes but definitely holds your attention better. Episode 3 is the shortest one but the conclusion of the story definitely leaves you scrambling to find more videos by Ranboo .You have to get used to the idea that you never completely know whats going on but wow . It actually was very impressive ,the acting ,the props ,the story . Bravo 👏 I sincerely hope he pursues this direction of content further .

                    This has to be the best thing I've ever seen in absolutely ages! Acting was top tier especially in the last episode, been absolutely hyper fixating on this for the past month or so before it even came out and honestly o would do anything to watch it for the first time again the utter shock over everything that happened I hope this gets continued for a sequel because it would honestly make my year. I would recommend this to anyone it's so good and I've ranted about it to absolutely everyone I know as this can either just be a show or you could go into the lore and theorys on it wich there are many!

                <p>
                    If you like the Truman Show, the Saw movies or horror, then this is the series for you. I'll try to keep this review spoiler free as possible.
                    <br><br>
                    Storyline- The first episode was a good start, and although is more comedy than horror based on first watch, theres a feeling of dread at the end. I understand why people didn't like the little horror that there is but it build on the show. And after watching the second episode, this episode is definitely more creepy on rewatch.
                    <br><br>
                    The second episode is longer but more horror inducing than the first. Although some scenes are drawn out, the ending gives a feeling of dread after the build up. The last episode is definitely the best, with a good story wrap at the end, with good acting, fourth wall breaks and influences of the audiences decisions.
                    <br><br>
                    Characters- Ranboo had a nice basic costume design up the the mask. The mask suited both the character and the actor themselves. Although Ranboo said they didn't like acting as much as directing, I think the last episode was definitely some of their best acting in the series. The rage when he picked up the camera and slammed it to the table and his final walk towards the end was definitely the best parts.
                    <br><br>
                    Charlie was a character that became better and better throughout the show, with his final two scenes being some of his best acting and character building in the entire show. I hope he does more acting in other shows at it was so good.
                    <br><br>
                    Sneeg was really funny as well, and I was glad when he was brought back as a primary character in the second episode as there are some great scenes he plays well in.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyone else on the cast did really well overall, and no one felt out of place. Although I think H was a little too obvious (If you know what I'm talking about then you'll get what I'm hinting at), but I think each person was well casted and played. Most of the cast have never acted before and were improving but it fits with the tone of the show.
                    <br><br>
                    Everything else- The music. Holy smokes was the music good. Nathan (the person who made music) did a fantastic job and as someone who is studying Music as a possible career, his use of synths and weaving the Genloss symbol into the music is very impressive. I love the sets, again the abandoned shopping mall surprising fit the feel of the show. I also think the reveal of the Cabins real set is such a good scene. The lighting was great throughout the entire show, especially the light up of the mask as he's taken through the door at the end.
                    <br><br>
                    I don't think I can say much more without spoiling anything, just that Ranboo did at fantastic job. At 19, they've created something unique and fun and I still can't over over the finale.
